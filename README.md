opengl-c-framework
==================

This is minimal opengl framework using only c standard library and glfw

All the code within this project is still in early development and might not work as expected with
all inputs (there is hardly any bounds checking etc.). 

This repository is mostly for my own development purposes, but any comments and bug fixes are welcome. 

Also some of the code still uses deprecated opengl calls, I will try to remove them as soon as possible.
